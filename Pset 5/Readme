Problem set 5: Speller
In speller, the aim is to write a function in C that is able to 
  1. Accept as input a dictionary txt file and load its contents into memory
  2. Accept as input any txt file, read its contents and for each word against the dictionary

The specifications for this problem is to create a hash table that would store the contents of the dictionary and be used subsequently 
to check the words in any txt file provided as input.

I created a hash table where each element contains a linked list. For the hash function, I summed up the ascii values of each character
in the word and took its modulo with the number of elements of the hash table.
