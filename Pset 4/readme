**Problem 1: Filter**
In filter, the problem is to create a program in C that can apply 4 different filters to input image and output the corresponding images
with the correct filter applied. This problem requires the handling of pixel values for red, green and blue channels. 

  **Specifications**
  Image type: bmp 
  Filters required: grayscale. reflect, blur, edge
  
  In my solution I wrote a function for each of the filters.
  1.
  
  2.
  
  3. In blur, each pixel value is averaged with its nearest neighbours. For example, for a pixel centered in a 3x3 grid, the new value for
  the red channel of the center pixel is the average of the values from the red channel of all 9 pixels. Likewise for the green and blue 
  channels. Boundary cases are handled accordingly in the function.
  
  4. 
  
**Problem 2: Recover**
In recover, the problem is to create a program in C that can read the bytes stored in an input RAW file, recognise the jpeg files and output 
all the jpeg files contained within.

  **Specifications**
  Input file type: RAW file
  Output file type: jpeg
  
  In my solution, I wrote a function to search the RAW file in chunks of 512 bytes. For each chunk, the function searches for the
  sequence of bytes in hexadecimal that corresponds to that of a jpeg file header. An ordered list of jpeg files is output at the end.
